# Work Day Scheduler
This application allows the user to organize their daily work schedule by editing tasks for every time block. The time blocks are color coded to let the user know when time blocks have already past, are current, or are in the future. The application updates on an interval to keep the user aware of upcoming deadlines.

## Overview
* A typical work day schedule from 9am-5pm
* Color coded for past, present, and future time blocks
* Ability to save tasks in each time block
